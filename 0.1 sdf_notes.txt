Enabling integrations:

1) Enable SOAP web services and token-based authentication
    * setup -> company -> enable features
        1) On the SuiteCloud tab, under SuiteScript, select Client SuiteScript and Server SuiteScript.
        2) Under SuiteTalk (Web Services), select SOAP web services.
        3) Under Manage authentication, select Token-based authentication.
2) Create an integration record
    * setup -> integrations -> manage integrations -> new
        1) To help identify the integration, enter a unique name and description, such as Workiva Integration.
        2) Under Authentication, select Token-based authentication, and clear TBA: Authorization flow.
        3) Click Save, and record the consumer key and secret from the confirmation page.
            3.1) consumer key:          (also: cliend id)

            3.2) consumer secret:       (also: client secret)

3) Step 3. Create an integration role
    * setup -> user/7roles -> manage roles -> new
    1) Under General, enter a unique name to help identify the role, such as Workiva/NetSuite Integration.
        name: new_integration_role
        id: _new_integration_role
    2) Under Authentication, select Web services only role to enable the role to connect to only the NetSuite API, and not log in to NetSuite directly.
    3) Under Permissions, add the permissions to enable the integration, such as Full-level permissions to all relevant Transactions, Reports, and Lists in NetSuite.   
        i create with no permissions
    4) On the Setup tab under Permissions, add Full-level permissions for:
        4.1) SOAP web services
        4.2) Set up company
        4.3) To enable the role to only authenticate via access tokens, Login using access tokens
        4.4) To enable the role to create and revoke its own access tokens, User access tokens
4) Assign the role to the integration user
    * setup -> user/roles -> manage users
    1) Select -or create- the integration user for the connector.     
    2) Under Roles, assign the integration role to the user.
        setted: new_integration_role created in stept 3
5) Create the integration user's access token
    * setup -> user/roles -> access tokens -> new
        app_name:   test_integration
        user:       Larry Nelson
        role:       new_integration_role
        token_name: test_integration - Larry Nelson, new_integration_role

    ** this returns an ACCESS TOKEN WITH:
        a) TOKEN ID: 364d202712ba890b2163d9aaf6fe98b3d66b6ded2229abafcafd1314ecbbbd62
        b) TOKEN SECRET: fcdc685f930d9e54b50b50f403ecf8ed26ff45ea36820303eb6d883b607c4fd2
        

6) Set up the NetSuite Token Authentication connector
    * 

CONNECTING
1) Command palette -> enter an authentication ID:
    authentication ID = ??????
2) Press Enter to use the production domain
    
3) Enter the account ID: 
    account id: setup -> company information -> ACCOUNT ID (e.g: TD2906958)
4) enter the TOKEN ID: 
    received in our integration access token 
5) enter the TOKEN SECRET: 
    received in our integration access token
